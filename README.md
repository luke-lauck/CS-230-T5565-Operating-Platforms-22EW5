## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted us to design a website that allows their game, Draw It or Lose It, to be played on multiple operating systems.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Each section of the document is well documented, and each question asked were well replied. 

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design constraint helped with designing a well-drawn UML diagram which, in turn, was easily translated into working code.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The evaluation chart should be more about pros or cons and not both.  Two separate charts with pros and cons separately would have been better or a double sided chart with pros on the left and cons on the right.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user’s needs were explained with what the assignment end goal was, and the design constraints were well explained and specific enough to not find any issue with the end code.  It is important to code using design patterns that achieves the end goal to make it easier for future changes. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
For this example, it all came from the UML diagram that was set using the executive summary and design constraints.  For the future, I would remain using not only UML Diagrams but brain storming techniques to specify broad ideas.
